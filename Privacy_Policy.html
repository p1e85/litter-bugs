            <p>Welcome to Litter Bugs! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our web application (the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our practices.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information in a few different ways to provide and improve our Service:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and chosen public username. You may also voluntarily add information to your public profile, such as a short bio, your location, and a "Buy Me a Coffee" link.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We collect the content you create while using the Service, which includes your tracked cleanup routes, the photographs of litter you upload, and any details about meetups you schedule. We urge you not to include any personal information or images of people in this content.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymized Usage Data (Beta Phase Only):</strong> As outlined in our Terms of Service, we use Microsoft Clarity during our initial beta testing phase to understand how users interact with the app. This service collects anonymized data, such as session recordings and heatmaps, to help us identify bugs and improve usability. This data is not tied to your personal account information, and this tool will be removed after the initial testing period.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the Service.</li>
                <li>To display your public username, profile information, published routes, and scheduled meetups to other users as part of the community features.</li>
                <li>To calculate and display community-wide statistics and leaderboards.</li>
                <li>To improve the app's functionality and user experience by analyzing anonymized usage data (during the beta phase).</li>
                <li>To communicate with you if necessary, such as to respond to a support inquiry.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Publicly on the Service:</strong> Your public username, profile information (bio, location, etc.), published routes, and scheduled meetups are visible to other users of the Service to foster a sense of community. Your email address is never made public.</li>
                <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party services like Google Firebase to host our application and store data. These providers have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we are required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Security and Retention</h2>
            <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect the security of your information. All data is stored securely using Google Firebase's infrastructure. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time using the "Permanently Delete Account" button in your profile settings.</p>

            <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
