            <p>Welcome to Litter Bugs! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Litter Bugs web application (the "Service"). Please read them carefully. By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By creating an account or using the Service in any way, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Litter Bugs is a platform designed to empower individuals and communities to track and document their cleanup efforts. The Service allows users to map their cleanup routes, geotag photos of collected litter ("Garbage"), view community-wide efforts, and organize cleanup meetups.</p>

            <h2>3. Age Requirement</h2>
            <p><strong>You must be 18 years of age or older to use this Service.</strong> This includes creating an account or using the application as a guest. By using this Service, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.</p>

            <h2>4. User Conduct and Content</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for your conduct and any data, text, information, and photographs that you submit to the Service. You agree that you will not:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Upload any photograph containing identifiable people, personal information, or private property without consent. The focus of all uploaded content must be exclusively on Garbage and the cleanup area.</li>
                <li>Post any content that is illegal, defamatory, obscene, or promotes hate or violence.</li>
                <li>Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Analytics and User Feedback (Beta Testing Phase)</h2>
            <p>To improve the user experience and identify bugs during our initial beta testing phase, we use Microsoft Clarity. Clarity is an analytics service that helps us understand how users interact with our website. It captures anonymized session recordings, heatmaps, and other interaction data.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Clarity shows us where users click, scroll, and encounter issues on the site. This helps us find and fix bugs and improve the overall design.</li>
                <li><strong>What it does NOT do:</strong> All data is anonymized. We do not use it to collect personal information. Keystrokes in sensitive fields like passwords are not recorded.</li>
                <li><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> The use of Microsoft Clarity is **for the initial testing phase only**. Our goal is to use this feedback to build a better, more stable application, after which this specific tool will be removed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. User-Organized Meetups</h2>
            <p>Litter Bugs provides tools to help users organize public cleanup events ("Meetups"). You acknowledge that these Meetups are organized and attended by independent users of the Service. Litter Bugs is not a party to, and is not responsible for, any interactions or incidents that occur at these user-organized events. For your safety, always meet in public places, be aware of your surroundings, and exercise caution when interacting with others.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>You expressly understand and agree that Litter Bugs shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from your use of the Service or your participation in any user-organized Meetup.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page. You are advised to review these Terms periodically for any changes.</p>

            <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at [p1creationsco@gmail.com].</p>
